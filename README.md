**Description**

As a user, I want to be able to post where and when I will be playing disc golf, with the intention of hopefully playing with another user. I want to be able to see the directions or navigate to the closest course to me. I'd also like to be able to add a course location if it does not already exist and be able to chat with other users on the app.
